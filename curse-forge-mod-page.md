![Features](https://github.com/mobends/mobends-resources/raw/master/media/features.png)

If you think that Minecraft characters could be more realistic, instead of having steady and rigid animations, this mod is just for you!  It makes creatures seem alive, and adds variety of other epic features!

This mod is client-side. That means, you only need to install it on the client for it to work, no need to install it on the server.

![FAQ](https://github.com/mobends/mobends-resources/raw/master/media/faq.png)

**Q:** Will Mo' Bends be released for newer versions of Minecraft like 1.16?
> A: Yes, it's currently being developed. The progress is being shared actively on my Discord, I also hold weekly development streams. Hop on in!

**Q:** Will (insert mod here) be compatible with Mo' Bends?
> A: This depends on the mod. Due to the new system being implemented in 1.0.0, most mods should be compatible out of the box. If not, an addon to Mo' Bends can be programmed to add special compatibility with a certain mod or to add extra features. If there are any problems once 1.0.0 releases, report them on [GitHub](https://github.com/mobends/MoBends/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=)!

**Q:** I found a bug. Where do I report it?
> A: You can report your bug [here](https://github.com/mobends/MoBends/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=)! Make sure to provide screenshots and/or a proper description of the problem :D.

**Q:** I have an idea for a feature! Where do I suggest it?
> A: You can request features [here](https://github.com/mobends/MoBends/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=)!

**Q:** Will you backport to x version?
> A: Probably not, but if I were to, it'd be after 1.0.0 is released, and then ported forwards.

**Q:** Can I use this on x server?
> A: Mo' Bends is client side only, so it only needs to be installed on your client, not the server. Once it's installed on the client, feel free to play solo or online :D.
